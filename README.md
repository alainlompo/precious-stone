building great command line apps and clis with ruby and dart

This space will be used to build great command line applications as well as the interfaces that will allow us to talk with them in a more "personal" way. We will mainly work with dart and ruby to do this as these two languages are awesome at doing this kind of stuff. <br/>
You can take a look at dart features on it's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)'>wikipedia page</a> or directly on it's <a href='https://www.dartlang.org/'>official website</a><br/>
The same being true with ruby: read about it's amazing features <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)'>here</a> or <a href='https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/'>on the official website</a><br/>

<h3>Extra short learning curve for ruby</h3><br/>
If you have worked with such object oriented programming language as java, c# or c++, then ruby will be like the icing on the cake. You can learn it extra quick: we have included a short introductory example <a href='https://github.com/alainlompo/precious-stone/tree/master/short-learning-curve'>here</a>. It's a little hello world like sample. For more like it just take a look at the <a href='https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/2/'>The ruby's quickstart</a><br/><br/>

<h2>Extending your ruby platform with gems</h2><br/>
You use the <B>gem install</B> command to install extra features for your ruby platform via gems. A nice way to handle gems is through the use of the <a href='http://bundler.io/'>bundler gem</a>. Once it is install use <b><u>bundle install</u></b> to install a bunch of gems (through a GemFile similar to the one we've added in this repo). You will see a few lines telling you about the dependencies that are being install in order for you to benefit from the extra features.

<br/>
For the Linux/unix world <a href='https://rvm.io/'>rvm</a> is another great tool to help you install and handle your gems and their dependencies along with various ruby environments
