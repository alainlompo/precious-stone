building great command line apps and clis with ruby and dart

This space will be used to build great command line applications as well as the interfaces that will allow us to talk with them in a more "personal" way. We will mainly work with dart and ruby to do this as these two languages are awesome at doing this kind of stuff. <br/>
You can take a look at dart features on it's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dart_(programming_language)'>wikipedia page</a> or directly on it's <a href='https://www.dartlang.org/'>official website</a><br/>
The same being true with ruby: read about it's amazing features <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)'>here</a> or <a href='https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/'>on the official website</a><br/>
